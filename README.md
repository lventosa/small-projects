### **US Breweries Analysis** <a name="breweries"></a>

This simple project analyzes the geographical location and the different types of breweries in the United States. The majority of the analysis explores the relationship between states and types of breweries. Patterns on the names of the different breweries are explored as well. Moreover, basic data visualization techniques are performed across the whole project.

Language: **Python**. Status: Work in progress 🛠️

Project notebook available [here](./us-breweries/us-breweries.ipynb).

### **Who painted what? Artist Prediction Model** <a name="artists"></a>

This project consists of two separated parts. It first analyzes data from the 50 most influencial artists of all time using basic data exploration and visualization techniques as well as statistical modelling. Secondly, a predictive model is constructed to identify the author of a given painting.

Language: **Python**. Status: Work in progress 🛠️
